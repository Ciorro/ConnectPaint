# ConnectPaint
Created for [The Tool Jam 2 - itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/the-tool-jam-2), theme: **This tool has some serious limitations**.

ConnectPaint is a small, simplified vector art application. The shapes you're allowed to use in ConnectPaint are limited to straight lines, filled polygons, and points. Additionally, all shapes must be aligned with the points on the canvas.
